            Yes, you can play the game completely offline, especially in Human
            vs Human mode. This is ideal for long trips, airplane rides, or
            situations where you're without Wi-Fi. You can enjoy full
            functionality of the local multiplayer mode with just one device.
            Additionally, the AI mode is also available offline, so you can
            practice your skills anytime. Only the online multiplayer mode
            requires an internet connection. This makes the game a great choice
            for both on-the-go and stay-at-home gaming. Whether you're commuting
            or relaxing on the couch, the game works perfectly without needing
            to connect.

            main features including local multiplayer, AI battles, and
            customization options without paying anything. There are ads in the
            free version, but they are minimal and non-intrusive. If you prefer
            an ad-free experience, you can make a one-time in-app purchase to
            remove them permanently. There are no hidden subscriptions or
            recurring fees. It’s a fair model that lets players choose how they
            want to experience the game. Everyone can enjoy it without
            limitations.

            To remove ads, you can make a simple one-time in-app purchase
            directly from the main menu. Once purchased, ads will no longer
            appear in any part of the game. This means uninterrupted play
            sessions, especially useful during multiplayer or intense matches.
            The purchase is tied to your Google account, so you can restore it
            on any other device using the same account. There are no additional
            purchases required once you buy the ad-free version. It’s a
            one-and-done upgrade. The developers wanted to keep things simple
            and fair for all players.

            The AI in this game is designed to offer a solid challenge for
            players of all levels. It adapts based on your play style and
            becomes more strategic as you progress. Early matches may feel
            easier to help new players learn, but difficulty increases naturally
            over time. Experienced players will find that they need to think
            ahead and use deeper strategies. While not unbeatable, the AI can
            definitely surprise you. It's a great way to practice and improve
            your skills. You’ll likely notice personal growth the more you play
            against it.
